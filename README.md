# Multi-Element-Wing-Generator
## Overview
The main motivation for this project is to develop parametric modeling of a multi-element wing structure using a novel combination of:
1. Class Shape Transformations (CST) 
2. Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomials (PCHIP).

This provides us the following benefits/features.
1. Flexible and efficient fine tuning capabilities allowing for efficient design work flow.
2. Adaptible and versatile enough for coupling with optimization routines.
3. Support for Multiple wings and endplates, with the ability to have certain elements only in certain spanwise ranges
4. Ability to analyse and design around endplate - wing interactions.
5. Scalable Geometry Export in .STEP,.IGES ,and STL file configurations.
